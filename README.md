# purescript-typescript-importer

Experiment of writing a typescript importer for purescript. Very early stage and ongoing development, don't use it yet!

The current state of typescript support can be seen in the testfiles folder. In `testfiles/original` are the typescript input files and in `testfiles/golden` the expected output of the typescript support that is currently passing.

## Goals & non-goals

The goal of this project is to create a tool that generates useful and working purescript ffis from typescript type definitions. It is not meant to create a fully-fledged typescript to purescript transpiler, as I don't see much added value to this and it's also a whole different story scope-wise.
It is also (currently) not a goal to go the other way around, i.e. from purescript to typescript.

## Typescript <=> Purescript type correspondence
